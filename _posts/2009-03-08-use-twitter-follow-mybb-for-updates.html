<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/mybbgroup/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-223" style="float:right;" title="Twitter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/twitter.png" alt="Twitter" width="200" height="200" /></a>For those who use <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, the "social networking site without a business model", you can <strong>follow </strong><del>@mybbgroup</del><strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/MyBB">@MyBB</a></strong> for quick access to all of the latest on MyBB.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The Twitter handle is now <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MyBB">@MyBB</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For those who don't use Twitter, the concept is you have 140 characters to post status updates/messages. You can follow other users for easy access to their updates, and have people follow you.</p>
<p>We'll be using Twitter to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post updates to MyBB and what we're working on</li>
<li>Notify you of updates to the MyBB Blog and new threads posted in the MyBB Announcements forum</li>
<li>Point out interesting plugins, themes, tips and tricks that help you benefit more from MyBB</li>
<li>Exclusively grab feedback on new things, especially regarding the development of MyBB 2.0</li>
<li>Reach out to potential users who have questions regarding MyBB, and help out those who are having diffuclties</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't already have a Twitter account, why not sign up for one today? It takes less than 5 minutes and is a fabulous social networking tool.</p>
<p>(Shameless plug - you can also find me on Twitter: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/surfichris/">@surfichris</a>)</p>
