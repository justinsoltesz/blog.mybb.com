<h4>Search Private Messages</h4>

<h4>PHP 5.1.0 minimum</h4>
<p>As we have alluded in the past couple of years, MyBB 1.6 will be the first version of MyBB to run on PHP 5 installations only, and more specifically, servers set up with <strong>PHP 5.1.0</strong> as a minimum.  This is only an issue for about 10% of you who are still using a host running obsolete versions of PHP; it might be time to give your host a slight nudge forward if you are in this group.</p>
<h4>Thanks for reading!</h4>
<p>There are even more features that will make your MyBB experience even better. Stay tuned to find out more about MyBB 1.6!</p>
