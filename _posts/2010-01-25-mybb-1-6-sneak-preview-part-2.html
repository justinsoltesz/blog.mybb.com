<p>In the <a href="http://blog.mybboard.net/2010/01/01/mybb-16-sneak-preview-part-1/">first part</a> of the MyBB 1.6 sneak previews, we shared just four of the <strong>49 brand new features</strong> included in MyBB 1.6. Here are some more:</p>
<h4>Delayed Moderation</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/delayed-moderation.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/delayed-moderation.png" alt="" title="With delayed moderation, you can tell the forum to perform a moderation action at a desired time in future. For example, you can set a thread to be deleted after X days, remove the the redirects to a thread in Y days or unstick a thread after Z days. In short, you don't even have to be there to moderate your forums!" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<h4>Users Online in Thread</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/thread-online.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/thread-online.png" alt="" title="Just like you can see who is online in a forum, with MyBB 1.6 you can see who is online in a thread!" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<h4>Group as Moderator</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/group-moderator.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/group-moderator.png" alt="" title="In 1.4 you could add moderators for a forum only by inserting their usernames. In 1.6, however, you can give the name of their group (such as Moderators) to MyBB, and it will assign the permission to all of the members of that group!" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<h4>Removing/Changing Votes</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/undo-vote.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/undo-vote.png" alt="" title="In MyBB 1.6 you can permit some or all of the users to change or remove their votes in polls." class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<h4>User Notes for Mods and Admins</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/mod-note-1.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/mod-note-1.png" alt="" title="Administrators and moderators can now post some user notes on the profiles of other users." class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/mod-note-2.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/mod-note-2.png" alt="" title="These notes can only be seen and edited by administrators and moderators." class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<h4>More Secure Admin Login</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/acp-lock.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2010/01/acp-lock.png" alt="" title="MyBB 1.6 sets a maximum number of attempts to login to Admin Control Panel. If someone (probably a hacker) fails to login to the system after several attempts, the system will lock the admin account and an email will be sent to the admin with instructions about unlocking the ACP. This means hackers can't try to guess your admin password any more!" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
