<p>Hi there folks.</p>
<h4>What's all this about?</h4>
<p>For some time now the domain MyBB.com has been owned by another party and not used (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_parking">domain parking</a>). Numerous attempts have been made to purchase the domain for the MyBB project, but the price has always been too far out of our reach.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for 4 letter domains to be sold for upwards of $10,000 - in fact, when first approached, we were told they wanted $20,000 for MyBB.com. Thanks to <a href="http://community.mybboard.net/user-2877.html">labrocca</a>, we now have a price that is much more feasible for us to obtain. A special deal is open just to the MyBB Group to get this domain, but the offer is not open indefinitely.</p>
<p>We need to raise $3,000 to secure the domain.</p>
<h4>Why do we want this?</h4>
<p>We're glad you asked.</p>
<p>The MyBB.com domain will be beneficial to reach a larger audience who will see us as a striving project in need of recognition as the very competitive forum solution that we are.</p>
<p>MyBB.com is less effort to type in, and remember, than MyBBoard.net - which can be confusing. Is it MyBBoard or MyBB<strong>B</strong>oard? If it's MyBBoard, is the software called MyB Board, or MyB?</p>
<p>When you try to recall a website's domain, one of the hardest parts is the name and spelling, the next hardest is if it's .com, .net, .org, etc. Most times we'll try .com first - if we get the domain, you'd get us first try!</p>
<h4>What have you done for me?</h4>
<p>Over the years we have provided you with a forum solution that you've used for your hobbies, entertainment, leisure, business or maybe even a MyBB resource forum - whatever the case, we've been there with you every step of the way.</p>
<h4>Where do we start?</h4>
<p>Our staff members, labrocca and a few forum members have already expressed interest in donating an amount for the domain. Many thanks to Labrocca and Chris Boulton for already pledging $1,000 each, which brings down the donation goal to $3,000 but we'll still be quite a bit off. Without our staff and valued members we would not be where we are today, and without you, we cannot advance into a new era. We're counting on your donations to reach this goal.</p>
<p>Please consider how much you are able to donate towards our target, and if not, you can still assist us by spreading the word to your community or perhaps other MyBB users who may not know. Anything you can do will help us, and we are thankful for everything.</p>
<h4>I've heard enough, I'm ready to get involved</h4>
<p>We have setup a page on our website for the donation drive at <a href="http://mybboard.net/donation-drive/">our donation drive page</a>. You may find all the information you need to donate there.</p>
<p>If you would like to spread the word we have created an image you may place in your signature that will show the progress of the donation drive. Just place this into your signature:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>[url=http://mybboard.net/donation-drive/][img]http://mybboard.net/assets/images/donation_drive_sig.png[/img][/url]<br />
</code></p></blockquote>
<p>If you would also like to put it into your website, here is the HTML code:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://mybboard.net/donation-drive/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://mybboard.net/assets/images/donation_drive_sig.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you all in advance,<br />
MyBB Group.</p>
