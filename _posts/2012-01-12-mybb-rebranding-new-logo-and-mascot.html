<p>Early last year, we <a href="http://blog.mybb.com/2011/04/22/recruiting-creative-doodler/">announced the development of an official mascot</a> which would be used in a variety ways to promote MyBB and its official merchandise. After countless hours of hard work, we’re proud to unveil our lustrous new mascot.</p>

<p>During the planning stages, the MyBB team heavily debated on what would best represent MyBB. After numerous ideas, we finally decided on an astronaut, because we feel it best demonstrates the following attributes of our forum software: strength, power, friendliness and dominance.</p>
<p>However, the astronaut is currently unnamed; but you can help change that. We will be announcing a naming competition soon, so stay tuned for the details.</p>

<p>Is it a bird? Is it a pig? No! It's the MyBB logo! It's great that our users always find new ways of describing our speech bubbles logo but it's getting quite old and the team decided, along with our new mascot, we needed a new logo too.</p>
<p>We'll be using the new mascot and logo across MyBB when we launch 2.0, but we just couldn't wait to introduce them to you!</p>
<p>Lastly, none of this would have been possible without the talented work of Mike Creuzer (if you're interested in his services you can find him over at <a href="http://www.audentio.com/">Audentio Design</a>). We’ve been extremely honored to work along side him the past few months to bring you these new and exciting assets to MyBB.</p>
