<p>We have been working extremely hard behind the scenes for the last few months, and are pleased to now lift the covers upon the future of MyBB, and forums, to you the public. We feel assured that this new direction will both excite and amaze, and help us reach even more users across the world.<!--more--></p>
<p>May we present to you, the brand new <a title="MyBBWatch - New Horizons for MyBB 2.0" href="http://watch.mybb.com" target="_blank">MyBBWatch</a>.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/04/mybb_watch.png" class="blog-post__image-link" title="Meet the MyBBWatch, an innovative approach to community interaction and discussion."><img class="blog-post__image-link__image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/04/mybb_watch.png?w=300" alt="Meet the MyBB Watch - watch.mybb.com" /></a></p>
<p>The MyBBWatch brings community interaction and discussion to your wrist, no matter where you are. No more worries about cross browser compatibilities for your forum theme, as all smart watch platforms are supported by officially managed applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MyBBWatch provides the ability to run as a hosted service upon our own cloud servers. Never worry about downtime or server management again! Base packages, offering unlimited users and discussions are available at no cost, with an advanced package providing full professional support available from only $19 USD a month.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-03-31-at-14-23-55.png" class="blog-post__image-link" title="The full range of pans offered with the new MyBBWatch service."><img class="blog-post__image-link__image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2015/04/screen-shot-2015-03-31-at-14-23-55.png" alt="Available Plans for MyBBWatch - watch.mybb.com" /></a></p>
<p>The new MyBBWatch is of course fully customisable with new designs, modules and plugins, as you are used to from prior releases.MyBBWatch is also just as easy to install as ever before, with minimum requirements being PHP 5.8 and a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. However, all support for Linux based servers has been officially dropped due to recent security scares involving software such as OpenSSL. From here onwards, the MyBBWatch will run only on the Windows family of Operating Systems, with Windows Server 2012 being the recommended base Operating System.</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited for the future of MyBB as we are, we're all eagerly anticipating an early Q4, 2015 release. Keep tuned to the blog for more information and demos in the future.</p>
