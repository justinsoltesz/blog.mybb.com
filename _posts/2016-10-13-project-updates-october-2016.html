<p>Recently we have made a number of notable changes to the community and MyBB website. We'd like to share with you what we've done and how you can get involved.</p>
<h3>RFC Process and transparency policy</h3>
<p>For over a year now, the MyBB Team has been using an internal <i>Request For Comments</i> process as a decision making mechanism for issues with high impact on the Project's present and future as well as a mean of assuring team-wide consensus on matters related to its organization and development. Recently we have decided to start <strong>publishing our RFC documents</strong>, putting us closer to the goal of <strong><a href="https://mybb.com/about/rfcs/6-documentation-and-transparency-standards/">maximum transparency</a></strong>. Accordingly, solid plans, workflows and protocols explaining what exactly happens behind the scenes will be posted on our websites as they emerge to enable external feedback and simplify the process of Team onboarding.</p>
<p>You can find all RFC documents that were cleared for disclosure in a <a href="https://mybb.com/about/rfcs/">dedicated section</a> on MyBB.com.</p>
<h3>Code of Conduct in force</h3>
<p>As previously <a href="https://community.mybb.com/thread-198748.html">announced</a>, we have joined an <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/adopters/">impressive group</a> of open source projects you may already have heard of by <strong>adopting a Code of Conduct</strong> provided by the Contributor Covenant. This addition allows us to centralize rules and guidelines that apply in our development and community ecosystems in order to assure professional and inviting environment for everyone interested in getting involved. You can find the new document <a href="https://mybb.com/about/conduct/">on our website</a>.</p>
<h3>Moving to Discord from IRC</h3>
<p>The MyBB IRC channel over at <a href="https://freenode.net">freenode</a> has not been bustling with activity for a while despite several attempts to bring it to life, so internally we discussed and tested alternatives to IRC. Looking for something that is easier for the whole community to engage with, we circled in <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>, which fulfills our needs for accessibility and moderation features. We <a href="https://community.mybb.com/thread-198398.html">invited the community</a> to help us during the testing phase and are grateful for those that did - you can already find many members of the MyBB Team on Discord in addition to other valued members of our Community.</p>
<p>While the adoption of the platform appears to be successful, we've decided to continue maintaining our IRC presence at <code>#mybb</code> and registered a freenode group to gain more control over our channels. In order to keep the chit-chat uniform, we plan to connect it to Discord using a bot that forwards messages both ways from the IRC channel to its counterpart on Discord — this will assure that no question will go unnoticed.</p>
<p>We'll see you there!</p>

<h3>Up Next: Updates to Extend MyBB</h3>
<p>While not ready to go live just yet, we are excited to share an update on something Justin, our lead designer, has been working on for the past few weeks: a major visual update to the Extend MyBB platform, commonly known as the <em>MyBB Mods site</em>.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend1.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend1.png" alt="" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend2.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend2.png" alt="" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend3.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend3.png" alt="" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend4.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend4.png" alt="" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend5.png" class="blog-post__image-link"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2016/10/extend5.png" alt="" class="blog-post__image-link__image" /></a></p>
<p>The visual update touches all public-facing aspects of Extend MyBB, simplifying navigation and making its interface easier to use while maintaining existing features. There's still some more work to do before it's ready to launch, but we're sure you'll love it.</p>
